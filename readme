# Luke contribution
This assignment I added delay to our arguments and program. I then threaded our server 
program, which involved adapting previous code and creating a new class to handle 
server requests. Once that was working I updated the code to create a new request every
time the text in the search box changes, so that we could remove the submit button.
Then I threaded the client program so that the gui would not freeze while the client
waited to receive back data from the server.

# Sarah contribution
For this assignment, I worked on debugging. We had several errors in our code
from assignment 2, so I worked on fixing all of those errors for this assignment.
This included layout, error handling from the database, and bugs that caused our
program to crash. I also worked on checking the performance of the code to make
sure it matched the behavior of the reference file. I also worked on cleaning up the code
with pylint and testing it on armlab.
