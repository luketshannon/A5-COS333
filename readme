# Sarah contribution
For this assignment, I worked on debugging. We had several errors in our code
from assignment 2, so I worked on fixing all of those errors for this assignment.
This included layout, error handling from the database, and bugs that caused our
program to crash. I also worked on checking the performance of the code to make
sure it matched the behavior of the reference file.
